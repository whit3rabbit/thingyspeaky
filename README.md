# Thingyspeaky

A next.js app to view your thingspeak.com data/charts.

TLDR: Access here
https://whit3rabbit.github.io/thingyspeaky/

## Instructions

Use the sidebar to enter your thinkspeak API key (read only) and channel ID. They are saved as cookies and you may need to refresh the page after you submit.

** Nothing is saved on a backend, it's only saved in your browser **

## A simple react app to view your thingspeak charts.

* Uses cookies to save your api key
* Uses apexcharts
* Uses next.js/tailwindcss

## Why?

The logout timer on thingspeak.com is too short.  I wanted an easier way to view my charts without having to log in all the time.

Also, it gave me a chance to play with next.js.
